AKAN is a word originated from a Tupi (brazilian indigenous people) term, Akangatu, which means memory, intelligence.

The intention of the choice of the name comes from the team believe that democracy is only as good as who has the ability to elect also is able to remember who they elected and, above all, keep up with of those who they elected. This is the concept behind AKAN.


AKAN project aims to centralize information relating to spending on CEAPS - Quota for the Exercise of Parliamentary activities - during the mandate of parliamentarians elected by the brazilian population.
